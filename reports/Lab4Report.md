## Theory
Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between objects and classes. They provide a way to organize the behavior of objects in a way that is both flexible and reusable, while separating the responsibilities of objects from the specific implementation details. Behavioral design patterns address common problems encountered in object behavior, such as how to define interactions between objects, how to control the flow of messages between objects, or how to define algorithms and policies that can be reused across different objects and classes.
## Objectives:

1. Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns.
2. The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system.
3. The behavioral DPs can be integrated into your functionalities alongside the structural ones.
4. There should only be one client for the whole system.

## Implementation description

### Project domain
The project main idea is a car manufacturer that have a lot of dealerships and in each dealership the staff needs access 
to the vehicles information for customers or for the dealership itself. Also thy are having access to company advertisements, 
customers, factory, cars and staff. The project is structured in 5 main packages: marketing, production, staff, user, vehicle.
Each package contains classes that are related to the package name. The main idea of the project is to show how the SOLID principles are 
respected in the project and introduce all types of design patterns.
