## Theory
Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures and systems. They provide a way to organize objects and classes in a way that is both flexible and efficient, while allowing for the reuse and modification of existing code. Structural design patterns address common problems encountered in the composition of classes and objects, such as how to create new objects that inherit functionality from existing objects, how to create objects that share functionality without duplicating code, or how to define relationships between objects in a flexible and extensible way.
## Objectives:

1. Study and understand the Structural Design Patterns.
2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about the functionalities that your system will need to provide to the user.
3. Implement some additional functionalities, or create a new project using structural design patterns.


## Implementation description

### Project domain
The project main idea is a car manufacturer that have a lot of dealerships and in each dealership the staff needs acces 
to the vehicles information for customers or for the dealership itself. Also thy are having acces to company advertisements, 
customers, factory and staff. The project is structured in 5 main packages: assembly-line, carManufacturing, marketing, personnel and user.
Each package contains classes that are related to the package name. The main idea of the project is to show how the SOLID principles are 
respected in the project and introduce all types of design patterns.
